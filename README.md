# music-module

A python library extension for Ci40 using a Buzz Click. Adds notes and rests to quickly put simple (very high pitched!) tunes together.

Requires pyletmecreate from [here](https://github.com/francois-berder/PyLetMeCreate). Also requires a Buzz Click board attached to Mikrobus 1.

Put mm.py and your script in the same directory. Just add "import mm" to the top of your script. Call functions as follows:

mm.setf7()
mm.quarter_play()
